# Pastebin-worker

This is a pastebin that can be deployed on Cloudflare workers. Try it on [shz.al](https://shz.al).

**Philosophy**: effortless deployment, friendly CLI usage, rich functionality.

**Features**:

1. Share your paste with as short as 4 characters, or even customized URL.
1. **Syntax highlighting** powered by highlight.js.
1. Client-side encryption
1. Render **markdown** file as HTML
1. URL shortener
1. Customize returned `Content-Type`

## Usage

1. You can post, update, delete your paste directly on the website (such as [shz.al](https://shz.al)).

2. It also provides a convenient HTTP API to use. See [API reference](doc/api.md) for details. You can easily call API via command line (using `curl` or similar tools).

3. [pb](/scripts) is a bash script to make it easier to use on command line.

## Limitations

1. If deployed on Cloudflare Worker free-tier plan, the service allows at most 100,000 reads and 1000 writes, 1000 deletes per day.

## Deploy

You are free to deploy the pastebin on your own domain if you host your domain on Cloudflare.

1. Install `node` and `yarn`.

2. Create a KV namespace and R2 bucket on Cloudflare workers dashboard, remember its ID.

3. Clone the repository and enter the directory.

4. Modify entries in `wrangler.toml`. Its comments will tell you how.

5. Login to Cloudflare and deploy with the following steps:

```console
$ yarn install
$ yarn wrangler login
$ yarn build:frontend
$ yarn deploy
```

6. Enjoy!

## Auth

If you want a private deployment (only you can upload paste, but everyone can read the paste), add the following entry to your `wrangler.toml`.

```toml
[vars.BASIC_AUTH]
user1 = "$2b$08$i/yH1TSIGWUNQVsxPrcVUeR0hsGioFNf3.OeHdYzxwjzLH/hzoY.i"
user2 = "$2b$08$KeVnmXoMuRjNHKQjDHppEeXAf5lTLv9HMJCTlKW5uvRcEG5LOdBpO"
```

Passwords here are hashed by bcrypt2 algorithm. You can generate the hashed password by running `./scripts/bcrypt.js`.

Now every access to POST request, and every access to static pages, requires an HTTP basic auth with the user-password pair listed above. For example:

```console
$ curl example-pb.com
HTTP basic auth is required

$ curl -Fc=@/path/to/file example-pb.com
HTTP basic auth is required

$ curl -u admin1:wrong-passwd -Fc=@/path/to/file example-pb.com
Error 401: incorrect passwd for basic auth

$ curl -u admin1:this-is-passwd-1 -Fc=@/path/to/file example-pb.com
{
  "url": "https://example-pb.com/YCDX",
  "admin": "https://example-pb.com/YCDX:Sij23HwbMjeZwKznY3K5trG8",
  "isPrivate": false
}
```

## Administration

Delete a paste:

```console
$ yarn delete-paste <name-of-paste>
```

List pastes:

```console
$ yarn -s wrangler kv key list --binding PB > kv_list.json
```

## Development

Note that the frontend and worker code are built separatedly. To start a Vite development server of the frontend,

```console
$ yarn dev:frontend
```

To develop the backend worker, we must build a develop version of frontend,

```console
$ yarn build:frontend:dev
```

Then starts a local worker,

```console
$ yarn dev
```

The difference between `build:frontend:dev` and `build:frontend` is that the former will points the API endpoint to your deployment URL, while the later points to `http://localhost:8787`, the address of a local worker.

Run tests:

```console
$ yarn test
```

Run tests with coverage report:

```console
$ yarn coverage
```

Remember to run eslint checks and prettier before commiting your code.

```console
$ yarn fmt
$ yarn lint
```
